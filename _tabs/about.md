I'm **Vamsi Maniyam**, a Cloud DevOps Engineer with over 10 years of experience building and managing scalable infrastructure. I specialize in **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, **GitOps**, **Terraform**, and **observability stacks**.



This blog is my space to document what I learn, share practical DevOps scenarios, and help others solve real-world challenges.
